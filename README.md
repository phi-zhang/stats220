# stats220

This is a repository containing projects made for a class called **STATS 220: Data Technologies** at the University of Auckland. I've uploaded the .Rmd files as-is for now, but hopefully I'll have the chance to optimise things and write nicer project reports in the future. I actually did 5 projects for this class, but I felt the first 4 made for nicer finished products.

*(I might add a more formal license later, but in the meantime, feel free to use this code for anything non-commercial. Maybe don't copy-paste it for your own STATS 220 project, though.)*

Check out the project reports in a nice web format [here](https://phi-zhang.github.io/stats220/).

## Meme Creation

The code recreates [the "galaxy brain" meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/galaxy-brain), with inspiration from the general pattern of memes which show a progressively "better" image next to things which the meme creator likes better. Included is my report on its creation.

- What if, instead of your brain expanding, your cat woke up and got swag?
- This should be able to be made into an interactive meme creation tool at some point, for memes following the "image panel - text panel" format.
- Or else, feel free to download and edit the code to make your own meme.
- Also feel free to download the cats for non-commerical use.

## Snacking Survey
- I surveyed some of my friends and family, and made a report on the survey results
- The survey is designed so that it could be taken over multiple weeks, but the participants just filled it once for this project.

## Pixabay photo exploration
- This was a test run to see what it's like to analyse social media data.

## Data story
- I made a nice little visualisation GIF about my favourite Virtual YouTubers' careers.
