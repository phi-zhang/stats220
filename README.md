# stats220

This is a repository containing projects made for a class called **STATS 220: Data Technologies** at the University of Auckland.

*(I might add a more formal license later, but in the meantime, feel free to use this code for anything non-commercial. Maybe don't copy-paste it for your own STATS 220 project, though.)*

# Projects in this repo

1. Meme Creation
2. Snacking Survey
3. Others coming soon!

## Meme Creation

The code recreates [the "galaxy brain" meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/galaxy-brain), with inspiration from the general pattern of memes which show a progressively "better" image next to things which the meme creator likes better. Included is my report on its creation.

- What if, instead of your brain expanding, your cat woke up and got swag?
- This should be able to be made into an interactive meme creation tool at some point, for memes following the "image panel - text panel" format.
- Or else, feel free to download and edit the code to make your own meme.
- Also feel free to download the cats for non-commerical use.

## Snacking Survey
- I surveyed some of my friends and family, and made a report on the survey results
- The survey is designed so that it could be taken over multiple weeks, but the participants just filled it once for this project.
